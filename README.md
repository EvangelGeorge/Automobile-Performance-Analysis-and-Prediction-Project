# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

EDA entails computing basic summary statistics and exploring distribution and correlation in a dataset

There is also some data visualization involved.

# About the dataset

The dataset contains info about automobiles. It has 201 rows and 29 columns.

# Conclusion: Important Variables

<p>We now have a better idea of what our data looks like and which variables are important to take into account when predicting the car price. We have narrowed it down to the following variables:</p>

Continuous numerical variables:

<ul>
    <li>Length</li>
    <li>Width</li>
    <li>Curb-weight</li>
    <li>Engine-size</li>
    <li>Horsepower</li>
    <li>City-mpg</li>
    <li>Highway-mpg</li>
    <li>Wheel-base</li>
    <li>Bore</li>
</ul>

Categorical variables:

<ul>
    <li>Drive-wheels</li>
</ul>

<p>As we now move into building machine learning models to automate our analysis, feeding the model with variables that meaningfully affect our target variable will improve our model's prediction performance.</p>
