# Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of an automobile company's dataset and develop accurate machine learning models for predicting automobile performance metrics. By employing EDA techniques and advanced modeling, we aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and factors that influence automobile performance, thereby providing valuable insights to stakeholders. The dataset contains info about automobiles. It has 201 rows and 29 columns.


# Methodology
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Exploratory Data Analysis phase involves preprocessing the dataset, performing univariate and bivariate analyses, and visualizing key insights. Missing values are handled, duplicates are removed, and data normalization/standardization is performed as needed. Univariate analysis provides a summary of continuous numerical variables, while bivariate analysis explores relationships between categorical and continuous variables, utilizing correlation analysis and visualizations. These are the variables been used:
Continuous numerical variables:
<ul>
    <li>Length</li>
    <li>Width</li>
    <li>Curb-weight</li>
    <li>Engine-size</li>
    <li>Horsepower</li>
    <li>City-mpg</li>
    <li>Highway-mpg</li>
    <li>Wheel-base</li>
    <li>Bore</li>
</ul>

Categorical variables:
<ul>
    <li>Drive-wheels</li>
</ul>

# Machine Learning Models
The Machine Learning Models phase focuses on harnessing the dataset's insights to develop accurate prediction models. Feature selection and engineering are carried out, followed by a rigorous process of selecting suitable regression algorithms. These algorithms are then trained on the dataset, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Model evaluation is performed using industry-standard metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

# Conclusion: Important Variables

<p>We now have a better idea of what our data looks like and which variables are important to take into account when predicting the car price. We have narrowed it down to the following variables:</p>

<p>As we now move into building machine learning models to automate our analysis, feeding the model with variables that meaningfully affect our target variable will improve our model's prediction performance.</p>
